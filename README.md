# ☕ Brew Heaven Dashboard Analysis

## 📌 Overview
Guided Project on analysis of cafe's sales, inventory management, and customer feedback using MS Power BI

In Coursera, they have a guided project where you act as an analyst for a ficticious stakeholder called Brew Heaven.
They provided a step-by-step task along with a series of datasets in one excel file that would need to be cleaned,
transformed, and given relationships before loading into Power BI's systems for the creation of a dashboard. From
there, you would create the dashboard with one page dedicated to sales and another dedicated to management. In
putting myself in the role of the analyst, I found certain ways to improve upon the project to provide more insight
than would be possible had I only completed the task as described. As such, not only is this a publication of the
completed task, but also a slight expansion upon the original project.
